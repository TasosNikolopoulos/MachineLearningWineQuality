# Machine Learning Wine Quality

The project about wine quality was created with dataset that was provided by kaggle.

The aim of this analysis is to use the data to find insights about the quality of each wine, use linear regression and test and train sets to predict the quality of the wine and with what error.

The data contained two .csv files, one with the data about red wine and the other one about white wine. Both files contained information about thee following characteristics : fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, alcohol and quality.

Regarding the process that was followed :

• Importing the libraries
• Importing the datasets
• Displaying the datasets for red and white wine
• Displaying dataset info
• Dropping the duplicate values
• Description of each dataframe (statistical values)
• Appending the one dataframe to the other
• Correlation matrices regarding the quality of the wines
• Plot of the number of wines regarding their quality
• Plotting the wine quality standards (Low, Medium, High)
• Creating proportions for the quality of the wine
• Linear regression method for the dataset of the red wine
• Seperation of the data in Train and Test sets for predictive analysis

The data analysis and machine learning methods were done with Python in the Jupyter Lab of Anaconda.
